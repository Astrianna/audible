window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Bram Stoker nominated author Jake Bible, comes an exciting new LitRPG adventure series! </p> <p>In the 23rd century, the world is at an end, and a group of gaming and programming friends decide that their only way to survive is to discard their bodies, and send their minds into the quantum matrix of a virtual gaming world. They have created the Domains, and there they plan to reside forever. </p> <p>Except, the nightmares of reality have followed them into their new quantum dimension, and those nightmares threaten to destroy it all! </p> <p>Now it is up to one of them to help navigate the quantum platform known as EverRealm, a fantasy MMORPG of epic proportions, in order to complete a quest he neither wants to complete nor knows how. With the help of his friends, and a lot of luck, he will have to face trials and tribulations like he's never faced as a player! Because now it is no longer a matter of Game Over, but of life or death! </p> <p>Can he survive it all and come out a winner? The only way he'll know is if he plays the game to the bitter end! </p>";
