window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Surviving a plane crash wasn’t easy, but surviving the apocalypse will be nearly impossible. Nigel Fletcher finds himself stranded on a deserted island with nothing but his journal and the clothes on his back. Not only must he locate food, water, and shelter to survive, but Nigel will also have to combat wave after wave of savage monsters intent on ridding the world of humanity. </p> <p>Clearing these waves grows progressively harder as each week brings additional monsters, new mutations, and behind them all, a living terror with an insatiable appetite for human flesh. To have even the slightest chance of surviving, Nigel will need to build up his island base to perfection with what limited resources he has available. Crafting weapons, taming beasts, erecting towers.... It will take an enormous amount of grit and determination to transform this deserted island into one of humanity’s last bastions of hope. Will it be enough?</p>";
