The stakes get higher, as the means to fight the aggressors finally become available. But has he risen too high? Or are the consequences of his own actions interfering with his judgement?</p> <p>As fast as you move, the past is faster and always catches up with you when you least expect it. This is not a game, and being a hero has its own price tag.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just where is the point, where you make, or break, the hero?</p>";
