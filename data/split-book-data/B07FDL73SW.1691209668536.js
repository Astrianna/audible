After thwarting an evil plot to destroy Royal Moffit, Sorch became the prisoner of a demon-worshiping cult. They imprisoned him in an attempt to steal his nightmares.</p> <p>One daring jailbreak later, Sorch is unleashed upon the world again.

He embarks on a quest to save his friends, who were trapped on another plane of existence.
