window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Where were you the day the Turning happened?<br> <br> It was a phrase that meant nothing…until it did.<br> <br> Because about four weeks ago, the world simply turned. One day we had iPhones and GoPros, Mickey Mouse and hamburgers. The next day we had magic and monsters. <br> <br> And us humans? We became players with levels, items, and classes. Pretty ironic considering how many times my parents told me to “quit gaming and experience real life” while I was growing up. And then real life grabbed us by the balls, and it was the gamers who were prepared. <br> <br> But I’m getting ahead of myself. You probably want to know how I managed to get to level 13 in a single day. How I mastered the art of Eternal Flame and Absolute Zero. How I managed to summon a gigaclops and tame a tarasque. <br> <br> But perhaps you’re more interested in legendary weapons? Perhaps I can tempt you with a tale about how I forged the ancient Frostcaliber and used it to slay the lich king. Or if Leon Kennedy’s your kind of guy, I did save the president’s daughter, but instead of zombies, it was bloodthirsty apes. <br> <br> But if none of those are your thing, how about just a simple tale about a guy, his best friend, a loyal golden retriever, a little girl, and her beloved cat? Practically heartwarming, right? Well, all except for the copious amounts of gore.</p>";
