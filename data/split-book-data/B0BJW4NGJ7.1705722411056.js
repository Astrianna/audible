window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After overcoming the assault in Eternal Dominion by Abysses End's members, Alex/Xeal and his friend have shown that they can stand firm. Now they must navigate Abysses End's advances in reality without isolating themselves from the entirety of the VR gamming workshop community. While the nobles of Nium have begun to take a vested interest in Alex's/Xeal's progress. Will Alex/Xeal and his friends be able to navigate these diplomatic situations or will they find themselves dancing to the tune of others.</p> <p>As a fair warning, this book contains a harem element and will establish what I consider its core four. For any worried about it moving forward, this book will be by far the heaviest in that aspect, and the following books will still progress the subplot but have far less of it overall.</p> <p>Two major things to be clear about:</p> <ul> <li>One, I do not write smut scenes. You will know it happens, but details are left almost completely out of the book.</li> <li>Two, each and every woman who will be added to the story has a purpose for the long term of the story, even if it is not clear right away, and not all who appear to be joining the harem will be.</li> </ul> <p>Thank you all for giving Eternal Dominion a chance even if you didnâ€™t like it. As a new author, it really mean a lot to see so many giving me a chance.</p>";
