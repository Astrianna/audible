window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>There was a mistake, an error.</b></p> <p>No king ordered his summoning to battle a demon lord. No god sent him to save the world from destruction. In fact, the closest thing this world has to a god would have been very upset at his presence. Fortunately for him, by the time she noticed, it was too late to interfere. A soul had fallen into the world that did not belong there. A soul not bound by the Law of the world. A soul that was free.</p> <p>When Peter suffers a too-close encounter with a truck, he finds himself reborn in another world. At first glance, it is a perfect fantasy land. There's magic to play with, elves singing in the forest, and a hyperactive catgirl neighbor. There's even a System that lets him earn skills and level up.</p> <p>It isn't long before he notices that the world is far too perfect. Just why is everyone so nice? Can Peter accept the alien morality of this world's self-proclaimed protector? Or will he seek to overthrow her?</p> <p><i>An Unbound Soul: Part 1: Law</i> is the second volume set in Erryn’s World, and the first in the continuing tale of Peter’s adventure.</p>";
