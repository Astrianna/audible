window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It's humans against monsters in a high-octane race for survival in the second installment of this apocalyptic pedal-to-the-metal LitRPG adventure.</b></p> <p>Ever since the System brought magic and monstrous mayhem to Earth, long-haul trucker Jill \"Junkmouth\" MacLeod has had a need for speed. The highway snaking through the Midwestern plains is the battleground, and the stakes are the lives of not only Jill but thousands of survivors along for the ride. Together with Bertha, her mega-upgraded, fully-turreted, heavily-armored Soulbound big rig, Jill has the edge—so far.</p> <p>The good news? For every blood-hungry abomination Jill has flattened into roadkill, she's gained experience, levels, and loot to upgrade Bertha. The bad? It's still a long and dangerous road to the East Coast, where her family is waiting for her. She just has to keep the pedal pressed down as they blaze their way through hordes of ever-stronger monsters and across a Midwest that is far bigger—and wilder—than it should be.</p> <p>But if Jill thought the fallen city of Billings behind them had been bad, the road east is even worse. Outside of Bertha, the magic keeps growing more powerful, making everything—even the plants—deadlier and smarter. And inside, a darkness is taking root among the passengers, including those Jill counts on the most. Now Jill herself, so used to taking on the open road alone, will have to learn to lead—and maybe swear less. Maybe.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit LitRPG adventure series—with more than 500,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
