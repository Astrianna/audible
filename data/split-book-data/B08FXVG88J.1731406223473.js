window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As if by a miracle, Eli gets a spaceship named </b><b><i>Night Stalker</i></b><b> and wants to explore the galaxy.</b> </p> <p>It seems like fun, but there’s one slight problem — miracles don’t happen. Advanced Gaian technology dominates the universe, and it is known as the GAME. Using it without authorization to materialize <i>Night Stalker</i> is prohibited and makes Eli an intergalactic fugitive. </p> <p>As if that were not enough, at the whims and vagaries of Gaian politics, he becomes entangled in an intergalactic conspiracy to steal the leading-edge machinery. Game on! What's a little exploration without all-powerful alien authorities, space battles, and a suicide mission to save the girl? </p> <p>Plunge into the epic Book I of the Midas Touch trilogy — if you're a fan of <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, you'll love this space opera adventure. </p> <p>Warning: This book contains some strong language and graphical depictions of violence.</p>";
