And now into the middle of all this, his instructor just got drafted by some mystical goddess to help save a world.</p> <p>As for Paul? Well, he's really not supposed to be there, and if he thought he was having a bad day before all of this, it just got worse, a lot worse. He's now on a one way trip, forced to help a man who despises him while at the mercy of the world's biggest trickster.</p> <p><b>From book 2</b>: Coyote has a new task for Paul, one that involves him traveling north hundreds of miles over the post-apocalyptic landscape of California, the place that Paul once called home.</p> <p>Thankfully, Sarah and Heather have both decided to go with him and between Heather's shooting skills and Sarah's magical ones; Paul thinks he might just live through whatever scheme Coyote has enlisted him in. If he can live through telling the girls just what Coyote's got him carrying in his pack now of course.</p> <p>At least he's done with Riggs and hopefully won't have to deal with him ever again, nothing could be worse than that after all!</p> <p><b>From book 3</b>: Coyote has one final task for Paul, the one that is the whole reason Coyote shanghaied him here in the first place. But what can a single man, without the gifts and benefits of the gods, do against a creature that has ruled in the wastelands for hundreds of years? Besides, destroying Aybem is supposed to be Riggs' job! So just why does Coyote need him to go there too? While it's true that Riggs has finally earned Paul's grudging respect, Paul has no desire to suffer the pain that his nemesis' plans often cause him. And even if he is successful, is this really the last task that Coyote wants of Paul? Or could the trickster god have just a few more things that he needs to have done?</p>";
