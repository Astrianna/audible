What he doesn't need is his whole concept of home to be challenged. Not when there is so much else to do. The answers he's long wanted are now within his grasp. But does he really want to know the truth? Can he handle the truth? And what else is there he doesn't know about? </p> <p>The Darkness is coming, and Gaia has its role to play. But Prophecy doesn't care who believes in it. It unfolds as foretold. Shock follows shock, and as the stakes get higher, Jon's grip on reality comes down to one simple question. </p> <p>A question everyone else knows the answer to. </p> <p>Home is where the hero is.</p>";
