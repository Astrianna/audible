And, now Erianna has gone missing….</b></p> <p>For Will, he seeks first to absorb the power of the dead Voidbringer Core and then expand to find all the nearby cores. Perhaps, he can ally with them, or even protect them from the Voidbringer threat. In addition, he intends to undergo the trial to discover his third magic with the aid of Amber. Lastly, he must deal with the increasing number of dungeon fairies that are dependent on him.</p> <p>For Gar, he must level up, becoming powerful enough to defend his nascent barony, all the while navigating the politics of his family, his neighbors, and his new relationships.

Not only that, he seeks to discover the whereabouts of the missing Erianna before something terrible befalls her.</p> <p>The Voidbringer corruption has spread deep. Anyone is a potential enemy, including the nearby cores. Any dungeon core lost will turn into a nightmarish threat. Can Will and Gar prevent the corruption of everything they hold dear?</p>";
