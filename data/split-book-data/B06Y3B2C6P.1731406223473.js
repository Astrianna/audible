window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Last voyage, Captain Maddox entered a distant star system with a Swarm fleet. The sheer numbers were staggering, a 100-1 advantage against all human spacecraft. If the highly aggressive, racist insects gained hyper-spatial tube technology - allowing them to cross 1,000 light-years in seconds - it would mean Armageddon for Earth. </p> <p>Star Watch desperately needs something powerful to offset the annihilating Swarm numbers. As if on cue, Professor Ludendorff declares he has discovered the whereabouts of ancient Builder technology, a tech so potent it could defeat the Swarm. </p> <p>Star Watch takes the bait, ordering Captain Maddox to find the lost planet holding the ancient technology. </p> <p>Ludendorff has a plan involving androids to lure his arch rival - Methuselah Man Strand - to his doom. </p> <p>The crew of Starship <i>Victory</i> knows nothing of this, and thus blindly enters a web of intrigue and danger. The captain will need the AI Galyan, Valerie, and Riker like never before. Humanity's hope against the coming Swarm holocaust rests on the outcome. </p> <p><i>The Lost Planet</i> is the sixth book in the Lost Starship series. </p>";
