window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The entire best-selling Dungeon World series is now together in one volume!</b> </p> <p>This Dungeon World Series Box Set includes: </p> <p>Dungeon World, Books 1-5 <br> Bonus short story </p> <p><b>In a world five times larger than Earth, dungeons and their Dungeon Cores have become the top of the food chain.</b> </p> <p>Millions of dungeons inhabit the planet, utilizing the Human people as a source of much-needed Mana to facilitate their own growth; in turn, the humans delve into the dungeons to acquire their own power in the form of Essence, which allows them to develop and enhance themselves in a multitude of different ways. It is a symbiotic relationship that has lasted thousands of years and has brought about a measure of peace. </p> <p>Far in the northern wilds where no Humans (and therefore - no dungeons) regularly frequent, a young man is left alone when his parents are suddenly murdered. Now, without friends, family, supplies, or even much knowledge of the wider world, Fredwynklemossering embarks on a journey to discover who - or what - killed his parents. Along the way, however, he learns more than he bargained for, including his seemingly impossible status as a Dungeon Core/Human hybrid. With that knowledge comes a shift in his objective; revenge against those who wronged him turns out to pale in comparison to the dangers the Humans will face in the future. </p> <p>Will Fred be able to successfully straddle the line between the Human and Dungeon Core worlds? Unfortunately, heâ€™ll have to, or else the entire Dungeon World may be doomed.... </p> <p><i>Contains 564,000 words, LitRPG/GameLit elements such as statistics and leveling, as well as dungeon construction and defense. No harems and no profanity.</i></p>";
