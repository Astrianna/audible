window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No memory, no resources, no secret lair, and no time to find her feet: this is the story of a self-made villain, and her fall into strife. Fleeing from unknown enemies and an early death, she emerges into a city gone dark in the aftermath of a complete systems failure. Hounded by heroes, menaced by gangs, and helped by the most unlikely of allies, she claws her way up from weakness to strength and works to build a better future for those who deserve it.</p> <p>To survive, she'll need strength to stand toe-to-toe against secretly supernatural foes, compassion to work with the dregs and outcasts of a broken society, and cunning to outwit intelligence beyond human kind.</p> <p>The challenge is greatâ€¦but she is Dire.</p> <p>And Icon City will never be the same again.</p>";
