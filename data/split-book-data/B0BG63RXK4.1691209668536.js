While I'd have fought tooth and nail to defend my home, their advanced technology defeated us with ease.</p> <p>The abominations stole our oceans, altered the land to remove our blighted creations, and stuck us in stasis pods to do with as they pleased. The rushed tutorial that revealed all this left me with a million unanswered questions about how they altered the planet—and me.</p> <p>Before I could fully understand my new reality, the aliens shoved me onto a surface inhabited by monsters, mythical creatures, and a leveling system I'd have to exploit to conquer New Earth.</p>";
