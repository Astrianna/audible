One of them is a long-thought extinct species of dinosaurs living at the country's core.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A massive earthquake rocks the mountain range within the Andringitra National Park. The splitting Earth reveals a network of tunnels, hidden away for millennia. Responding to the series of violent upheavals, a pack of hypersensitive predators flee their subterranean home; frenzied and hungry, they head for the surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Former Navy SEAL Ian Hunt begrudgingly accepts an offer to lead an exploratory team. What they uncover is the find of a lifetime... if they survive long enough to tell anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Dinosaurs are alive and well at the heart of the dark island.</p>";
