Magic, monsters and levels are new to him, and his real-world skills aren’t as useful as he thinks.</p> <p>Lucky for him, he’s used to adapting on the fly. And soon, the world will know why his squadmates called him Seraph, the death angel.</p> <p><i>Note: Events in Biomancer happen after Life Reset.
