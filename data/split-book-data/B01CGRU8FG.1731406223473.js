window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Demon spawn, they call him. Evil seed of the UnNamed One. Lirak wonders if they might be right. Sent on a holy quest to test his prophetic dreams, he returns to find his people scattered or slaughtered. Ruthless invaders and their dread warlocks spread death and destruction across the land. Before he can lead the remnants of his people in vengeance, Lirak must win their trust. But blades and arrows alone will not defeat this enemy. His only hope is to master warlock sorcery, turning their own fell powers against them. Can he learn their arcane secrets in time, or will the deadly power consume him? Only the seven gods could know, but they war amongst themselves, and Lirak is a pawn in their divine conflict. Even if he defeats the invaders, he fears his trials are just beginning. </p>";
