Spoiler: We're far from ready.</p> <p>But hey, I get a cool skill out of it. The goddess allows me to view anyone's strength, vivacity, and other attributes as though they were numbers on a menu and then use their life experiences to make them stronger. I can unlock their special skills, too, and it's all stuff no one else can see.</p> <p>Hence the girls: a beastkin builder, a negotiatrix made of slime, a half-elf gypsy who charms snakes - and more - seeking safe refuge and a place to belong.</p> <p>Think our ragtag group can survive a divine onslaught of apocalyptic proportions? I know what I think. <b>Come on in and find out.</b></p>";
