Pawn of the Forgotten. </p> <p>Rsiran now understands that he can use not only the arcane power of lorcith, but also that of heartstone. This ability makes him powerful, perhaps too powerful for some. Others know of his ability and seek to use him. </p> <p>After Brusus is attacked, Rsiran makes a decision that requires an unlikely ally, and brings him to dangerous Thyr, where the Scholars of Venass offer their aid, but for a price. </p> <p>But the scholars want Rsiran for the same reason as the Forgotten. While he strives to discover why, what he finds changes everything that he has come to believe, as he learns that the struggle he's seen is only the beginning to a greater battle. And somehow he's the key to ending it. </p>";
