For him, money is short, and like everyone, he needs to make enough to get by.</p> <p>When a huge battle is announced in the capital city New Eden, Harry will do anything to qualify. The only problem is that battles are controlled by Overseers, and Harry has some history with the Overseer of New Eden. Things aren't going to be easy for him.</p> <p>When fighters enter the battlefield, the real-world cities give way to fantasy lands filled whatever horrific creatures that the Overseers' cruel minds conjure up. The combatants wield swords, runes, skills, and spells in digital death battles.</p> <p>The fights might be virtual, but the danger is real. For Harry, the stakes couldn't be any higher.</p>";
