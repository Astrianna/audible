window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dungeons are a lot like sea turtles. They’re born in clutches of dozens, if not hundreds. A 100 may be born at one time, buried in still-burning cities, in forests where the canopy hides the sky, or in ocean trenches at the bottom of the sea. But, only one in a clutch ever makes it to the surface.</p> <p>Everyone knows about dungeons - monstrous factories that emerge out of the earth, full of riches and Arcana and power - and monsters.</p> <p>Mark doesn’t know anything about dungeons. He isn’t from this world. He's been reborn in another world. Just one problem: he is half of a dungeoncore. The other half? A dark lord.</p> <p><b>Start the adventure, and get this audiobook today.</b></p>";
