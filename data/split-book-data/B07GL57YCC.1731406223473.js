window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alvin had a rough week. Thrown into a digital death game, <i>Apocalypse Gates</i>, with only his wits and a less than helpful AI handler, Alvin's prospects for survival looked bleak. Managing not only to survive but to thrive, he helped build a settlement of survivors in Green River, Utah. Along the way he met the very sexy and broken Gothy. He's taken on the undead, mutated bugs and animals and the worst possible enemy - other people - and triumphed. Nothing looked like it would be a major problem, except for the flight of dragons. </p> <p>Now the Gates are opening, and Alvin and Gothy are heading out along the roads of America. They'll need to earn XP, upgrade their stats and gear, find new settlements, find allies, and hope they survive long enough to explore the world and each other. The end of the world had come, and a new one awaits. Welcome back to Apocalypse Gates. </p> <p>(This book contains adult situations, in all their horror and glory. Ranging from abuse to drug use to murder. It also contains graphic sex scenes, which contain elements of BDSM. You’ve been warned.)</p>";
