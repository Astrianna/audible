window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The final chapter in the Archangel Project Series.</b></p> <p>Beyond the borders of known space a Dark Fleet is gathering. Volka, 6T9, Carl Sagan, and their band of sentient faster-than-light ships are charged with finding the Dark's forces. But the enemy is closer than they realize, and the Dark's next strike will be sooner than they think.</p> <p>When the attack comes our heroes will be forced to evolve once more. Volka has become a true telepath. To fight the Dark, she must become a true leader as well. 6T9 is capable of destruction with a machine's lack of remorse. He must learn when to stay his hand...not just to save humanity, but to keep the woman he loves.</p> <p>They must succeed, because the Dark has been evolving too. Carefully. Methodically. And it will stop at nothing short of the extinction of the human race.</p>";
