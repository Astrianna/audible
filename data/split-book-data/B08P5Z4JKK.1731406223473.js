window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What do you do when you love singing, but you’re unable to speak?</b></p> <p>Cadence was born with a previously unknown disability that disrupted the some of the signals her brain sent to her vocal cords and hands, preventing communication through her voice or even through sign language. Despite that, she learned to communicate through writing and, when its use became more prevalent, text messaging. Because of this, she excelled throughout high school and even managed to get into college, rooming with her best friend, Jill.</p> <p>Unfortunately, her first day of college turned into a tragedy, as she ended up in the hospital after a violent attack. While she was recovering and confined to a bed while her body healed, Cadence was introduced to the NVERS by her best friend, which was a virtual reality system where she could experience a new game called <i>Uniworld Online</i>.</p> <p>It wasn’t just any game, though; <i>Uniworld Online</i> was the newest offering from Unitech, a company that designed a new method of fully immersing oneself into a game using special technology. Set in a fantasy setting with opposing Light and Dark Factions, the immersive virtual reality game was unlike any other the world had ever seen.</p> <p>Having never played any video games before, though, she didn’t know what to expect; the attitude of the rude and power-hungry players she initially met in-game nearly made her want to stop playing. After acquiring a particular quest, however, she found that <i>Uniworld </i>was even more complicated than she had imagined. Added to this, she chose to become a Bard class in the game and was able to do something she had never been able to do before, but had always wanted to: sing.</p> <p>With her new ability to sing, though, comes a whole new set of challenges - and dangers.</p> <p><b>Note: </b>contains LitRPG elements such as character progression, quests, skills, stats, and stat sheets. No harems or foul language.</p>";
