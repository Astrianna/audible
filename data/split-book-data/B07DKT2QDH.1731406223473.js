window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After experimenting with dark matter, Dr. Benny Aitken inadvertently opened a portal into another dimension. He found himself in a world called Rapto, a place where he was given magic powers and killing stuff made him stronger. A dark mage guild soon discovered the portal and found a way to get through it. Dr. Benny Aitken, self-proclaimed genius, had unwittingly visited a fantasy apocalypse upon earth. It's starting point? A small town called Pasture Downs.</p> <p>In a fit of desperation, Benny sends blue orbs back through the portal in the hope that a few heroic residents of Earth would find them and absorb their powers, granting them magical skills that they can level up by killing things. Who are these heroes of legend to be? Unfortunately, one of them is Ash Hobbes, a conman and self-confessed ass.</p> <p>After stumbling on an orb he becomes a blood mage. Together with a companion called FF, who lives in his head, Ash must learn to stop being such an ass and find the strength to save the world as a blood mage.</p> <p><i>Contains adult language.</i></p>";
