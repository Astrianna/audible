window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Super powers. Super harem. Super awesome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains adult content. Seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Who in his right mind tells both his lawyer and the judge presiding over his murder trial “F--k you!” while still in the courtroom? No one, right? Yeah, you'd be wrong about that. I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>You'd say the same thing if you were just found guilty of a murder you didn't commit, though. Call me crazy for going off like that in court, but trust me, you don't know crazy until you see what happened next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>I never believed in superheroes. I certainly didn't believe I'd become one, or that strategically forming a harem of hot <i>chicas </i>and getting down with them to unlock my superpowers would be the key to my survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Did I say my survival? I meant the universe's. No, really.... That's exactly what happened when I was taken to a galaxy of supers, thrown into a prison ship full of villains, and told it was up to me to stop them all. Read on, friend, because it gets a whole hell of a lot crazier from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: This audiobook contains gratuitous violence and sex, harems, a hot foxlike chick, breasts galore, heads exploding, and ample blood.
