window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Second edition: revised for content and additional editing</b></p> <p><b>On the run with only her voice to defend herself and her friends.</b> </p> <p>After the events which caused Cadence to lose consciousness within Uniworld Online, she was now being monitored by the company in charge of the game - Unitech. This surveillance meant that the fledgling Song Maiden had to watch what abilities she used within the game, otherwise she might attract the wrong kind of attention and be accused of cheating or hacking.</p> <p>Despite these setbacks, Cadence is joined once again by her friends Brendare and Wengla, as well as Mera - the grateful young woman the trio had narrowly saved from being sacrificed by Corrupted Druids. With new gear and a renewed drive to find and punish the players who had killed Cadence, they journeyed onward, getting stronger and picking up allies along the way.</p> <p>Danger is just around the corner, however, as they learn that Brendare and the “mysterious Bard” are being hunted by guilds desiring to know the secret behind their winning dungeon run. When Cadence and her party are forced to quickly make their way toward Lightforge - the Human capital city - they are presented with a whole new challenge: crafting.</p> <p>With everything going on within the game, Cadence is also ecstatic because her body in the real world is healing faster than her doctor had expected. In addition to her limbs recovering from the abuse they suffered at the hands of her attackers, something else is starting to heal which will change her life forever...</p> <p><b>Note: </b>contains LitRPG elements such as character progression, quests, skills, stats, and stat sheets. No harems and sparse foul language.</p>";
