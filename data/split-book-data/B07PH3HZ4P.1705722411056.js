Sylvester Carthage, illusionist and engineer, has the eccentric imagination the Menagerie needs to succeed creatively - but none of the people skills. Fast-talking Arbrook Huxley, meanwhile, has all the savvy the Menagerie needs to succeed commercially - but none of the scruples.</p> <p>To save their show, Carthage and Huxley risk everything in a royal talent competition, vying for the once-in-a-lifetime chance to perform for the future celestial queen. In this stardust- and spark-powered empire of floating islands and flying trains, the Electrical Menagerie's bid at fame and fortune means weathering the glamorous and cutthroat world of critics, high society, and rival magicians - but with real conspiracy lurking beneath tabloid controversy, there's more at stake in this contest than the prize.</p> <p>Behind the glittery haze of flash paper and mirrors, every competitor has something to hide...and it's the lies Carthage and Huxley tell each other that may cost them everything.</p>";
