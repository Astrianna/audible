window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Life is beyond dangerous when you are caught up in the ongoing war between Bethany Anne's group and the Forsaken. </p> <p>Both Vampires and Humans have been targeted, but if there is one thing that those who work with Bethany Anne learn, it is you are <i>Never Forsaken</i>. </p> <p><i>Never Forsaken</i>, book five in the Kurtherian Gambit, follows the story after <i>Bite This</i>. If you haven't read or listened to the preceding books, you pretty much have to. These are a series and many of the characters have been introduced in preceding volumes. </p> <p>Please note, as mentioned in another review, there is flagrantly foul language in this novel. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing. </p>";
