America's secret weapon.</b></p> <p><b>A nation off the rails...</b></p> <p>No one saw the first attack coming. A perfectly orchestrated assault on a mass-transit railroad line that left countless Americans dead. Intelligence experts are convinced this is no ordinary terrorist attack. To pull off something like this, it would take a deep-state traitor with dark foreign connections. And to stop them, it will take someone who isn't afraid to shed blood.</p> <p><b>A hero off the grid...</b></p> <p>Enter Barry Rivers, the Rig Warrior.

When Rivers revs up his tricked-out 18-wheeler and goes after a runaway train on a collision course with disaster, all bets are off. The war is on.
