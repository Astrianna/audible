window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>I'm a college student who watched with my own eyes as the world descended into hell. A Dark Sphere arrived on Earth, turning half the planet into zombies. They thrive on killing us—people—as every kill fuels their development and makes them stronger. Besides zombies, there are also mutants—mutated animals—plus monsters: bizarre creatures in possession of striking strength and abilities. Levels, skills, new yet unheard-of objects…our world has changed. We have only one hope of surviving: we need to fight. By killing zombies, mutants, and monsters, we're becoming stronger. And I, Andrew First, will be the strongest of them all.</p>";
