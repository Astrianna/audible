window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Captain Keyes is loved by the public but hated by Command. He captains the UHS <i>Providence</i>, an aging supercarrier and the last human ship not dependent on dark tech - technology humanity has used to rule over the galaxy since barely defeating the Ixa in the First Galactic War.</p> <p>Dominance has come at a cost. Over the decades, old allies have grown resentful, and when dark tech itself fails, Captain Keyes's predictions start coming true: those old allies are now enemies.</p> <p>But Keyes is not the only one proven right. As the galaxy plunges into war, the Ixan Prophecies are being fulfilled, one by one. Humanity's oldest enemy is on the rise, with weaponry never seen before.</p> <p>The fate of the galaxy now depends on Captain Keyes, his tired ship, and his oddball crew. It doesn't pay to be right.</p>";
