Worse, the New Men have found allies with an impenetrable stealth technology. </p> <p>This time, however, Earth is going on the offensive. Admiral Fletcher is headed to C Quadrant with a Grand Fleet. He's to liberate the captured planets and find the enemy homeworld. What he isn't supposed to do is die. </p> <p>The only one who can save humanity has been grounded. Captain Maddox is under suspicion because he's half New Man. But he's not going to stop. He's found something unbelievable.
