window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When a new dungeon is born, it wants nothing more than to have the most vicious monsters, the most cunning traps and the most shiny of loot.</b></p> <p>There is only one problem...but it's a rather big one. It finished its first floor years ago, but it still hasn't been visited by any adventurers! In order to find someone—or something—to explore its floors, or perhaps just to find someone to talk to, this dungeon will have to go way off script. But it soon discovers that going off script brings problems of its own, and that adventurers are not the only thing this world is missing.</p> <p><i>A Lonely Dungeon</i> is book one of Erryn's World, a story about a dungeon's journey of exploration and self-discovery in a dark and devastated world.</p>";
