window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hero or villain. A choice that every Icon, a person born with powers, eventually has to make if they don’t want to live a life of mediocrity. For most Icons the decision is easy. Just do what your parents did. Then, there is Hunter Monroe. A powerful young Icon born from the unimaginable union of a hero and villain. </p> <p>Seventeen years later Hunter is seen as a half-breed abomination by some, and as a certified powerhouse by others. With his time at Purgatory Academy, the premier institute for Icons, coming to an end, Hunter must embark on a two year internship with a supergroup. </p> <p>After being selected to intern with The Imperial Lords, the world’s leading supergroup, Hunter’s life begins to slowly unravel. </p> <p>Between a shaky love life, facing an old rival, and seeing his mentors for who they truly are, Hunter is in for the longest two years of his life. Things get more complex when an Icon serial killer emerges with unthinkable power, and begins to shed light on Hunter’s life that will leave him wondering if he should use his powers to save the world, or conquer it.</p>";
