Despite his spotty memory, he's pretty sure he didn't used to be a floating ball of light.</p> <p>He's also certain that he's not originally from this dangerous fantasy world...maybe. Okay, fairly certain. To make things stranger, he seems to be involved in something big, something magical...a game.</p> <p>Who was he before? Will his memories come back? Why does he have an assistant explaining the game's rules to him?</p> <p>He can evolve? There's a countdown timer?</p> <p>One thing Steve does know is that he needs to figure out what's going on fast, and if he is playing a game, even a deadly one, he plans to win.</p>";
