Not the most glorious existence, but Krea likes it just fine.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Sorin, a cranky old soldier, barges in and decides to take over her life, Krea is less than enthused. Sure, he saved her from a brutal death at the hands of the guards, and he did stop decrepit faerie monsters from eating her. But declaring she isn’t human and dragging her through a cursed forest to the Royal City is going too far.</p> <p>Now she is eyeball deep in magic-wielding nobles, shape-shifting dragons, assassins, and an ancient elf war that could destroy the empire. Her cloak is too small. Her horse thinks she wants to eat it and her companion resents her very existence.&nbsp;</p> <p>And then there's Dane.</p>";
