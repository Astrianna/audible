window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The pulsar...an ancient weapon of unimaginable power, one that threatens the Confederation with total destruction. The Union is preparing for the final invasion, one that cannot fail with the great artifact at the head of their fleet. The clock is ticking quickly toward midnight. </p> <p>There is a chance to avoid annihilation, a small one. The Confederation has its own ancient device recovered from the Badlands, a stealth generator. It is not as powerful as the pulsar, but it just may be enough. </p> <p>The generator can hide a single vessel, so Tyler Barron and the crew of <i>Dauntless</i> reunite to take their aging battleship once more into the breach. They will go to the Bottleneck, the system where the Union is preparing the final assault. They must sneak around the vast forces of the Union fleet, into the heart of the massively defended system, and somehow destroy the pulsar. </p> <p>The fleet will be with them, all the might the Confederation can muster, but success hinges almost entirely on <i>Dauntless</i>' desperate attack. And even if Barron and his people succeed in their mission, they will be trapped behind the enemy fleet, cut off and alone. </p> <p><i>Dauntless</i> is book six of the Blood on the Stars series. Blood on the Stars will continue with <i>The White Fleet</i>. </p>";
