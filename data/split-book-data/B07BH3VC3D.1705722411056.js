window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The City is an immense metropolis of crystal spires and wondrous magic. Beneath is the Dungeon, a vast underground world, and a source of endless treasure guarded by grotesque and deadly monsters. No one knows where the Dungeon came from, or why.</p> <p>Any who would dare face the dangers and riches of the Dungeon must first be transformed into a delver, a quasi-immortal creature whose every attribute is defined by numbers. Yet, the \"immortality\" offered is but illusory, for without consuming the crystal found only within the Dungeon, a delver will inevitably die.</p> <p>One young immigrant braves the Dungeon to remit money to his family, only to find much, much more. Friends, power, and secrets of the Dungeon.</p> <p>Perhaps even love.</p>";
