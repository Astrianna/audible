Little league trophies, comic book collection, straight A’s. Hell, I got myself into Dragontusk University of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A real Harry Potter, I was gonna be. But then I found out, the life of slaying dragons, the life of rescuing princesses, the life of a white picket fence and family photo Christmas cards...that was never for me.&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m a hobgoblin. And if one thing hobgoblins care about, it’s blood. Blood ties, blood debts. I’ve started with Mickey Mouse scores: Holding up liquor stores, dealing tree, squeezing Kobold Delis.&nbsp;</p> <p>But now, a big heist has come my way, and I just might land a real score, a huge score. Now, I just have to let go of worn out dreams, and accept what I am...a stone cold gangster.</p> <p>Warning: This book contains explicit language, explicit action, explicit everything. Adults only, all that jazz. If you’re a precious snowflake, this book is a friggin’ flame thrower.</p>";
