Worse, the New Men have found allies with an impenetrable stealth technology. </p> <p>This time, however, Earth is going on the offensive. Admiral Fletcher is headed to C Quadrant with a Grand Fleet. He's to liberate the captured planets and find the enemy homeworld. What he isn't supposed to do is die. </p> <p>The only one who can save humanity has been grounded. Captain Maddox is under suspicion because he's half New Man. But he's not going to stop. He's found something unbelievable. Now, he needs Starship Victory-an ancient, alien spacecraft-the AI Galyan, Meta, Sergeant Riker and the others to help him tear the greatest secret of all from the enemy. </p> <p>Maddox and his crew must succeed or humanity will drown in a sea of human extinction. </p>";
