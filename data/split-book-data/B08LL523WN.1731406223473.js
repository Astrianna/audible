window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Survive the Chaos</i></b></p> <p><b>When the lights go out, anarchy reigns supreme.</b></p> <p>After journalist Austin Merryman’s wife died, he and his 14-year-old daughter left home to travel the country in an old RV. But the comfort and renewal they sought soon descends into chaos.</p> <p>After a message from an old college buddy leads Austin to a bridge in the middle of nowhere, he finds his friend - now an NSA agent - waiting to give him a USB drive. Before the contents can be explained, machine gun fire strafes the bridge, killing Austin’s friend and forcing Austin into the raging river.</p> <p>Rescued downstream by a beautiful veterinarian, Austin learns that EMP attacks have thrust the world into eternal darkness and separated him from the only person he has left. Now, he’ll move heaven and earth to locate his daughter and make it to his brother’s prepper hideaway in Utah.</p> <p>But the post-apocalyptic world is no longer a friendly place. Resources are growing scarce. Factions break out along ethnic and religious lines. Everyone is willing to do whatever it takes to survive in an increasingly hostile environment. And Austin’s daughter is caught right in the middle of this splintering society.</p> <p>But an even deadlier foe stalks them as they struggle across the landscape. Someone who hasn’t forgotten about the USB drive Austin possesses.</p> <p>And they’ll do anything to get it back.</p> <p><b><i>Survive the Aftermath</i></b></p> <p><b>The new world order is at hand.</b></p> <p>Civilization has crumbled since the EMP thrust humanity back into the Stone Age, and dangerous factions now scavenge for scarce resources in this terrifying new world.</p> <p>Austin Merryman wonders what the future holds for his teenaged daughter and if the madness surrounding them is even worth surviving. For now, the group is safe in his brother’s prepper house nestled in the Rockies. But the calm can’t last forever.</p> <p>With 16 people crammed together in the tiny mountain home, tensions are bound to erupt. It doesn’t help that his brother’s lazy friend gets twisted pleasure from stirring up animosity, pitting brother against brother and daughter against father as battle lines are drawn.</p> <p>But decisions about who stays and who goes are ripped from their hands as information on the USB drive lays bare pieces of the NWO’s plans. Austin realizes the horrifying truth of why he’s in their sights, as well as the danger he’s brought down on those he loves most. When tragedy again strikes the small group, it will be up to Austin to make the hard choices necessary to ensure their survival.</p> <p>Until a dying man utters the single word that changes everything.</p> <p><b><i>Survive the Conflict</i></b></p> <p><b>The world has descended into a nightmarish hell. Death and destruction reign at every turn. </b></p> <p>Everywhere Austin Merryman has led his tightknit group of survivors has gone from bad to worse as enemies pursue them for the intelligence he possesses. Yet, his group remains steadfastly together even as the infighting continues.</p> <p>It’s only when the cryptologist traveling with them finally breaks through the last coded barrier, exposing the full extent of the data on the mysterious USB drive, that their luck finally seems to be turning. So many have already given their lives to secure the information, and now, they know why.</p> <p>Now, a small window of opportunity remains for stopping the new world order from succeeding in their plans, but Austin and his cohorts will have to move fast.</p>";
