Siv just wants to work his trade as a blacksmith, play cards at the saloon, and watch the stars. But he'll never be at peace without answers. </p> <p>What was the monster that burned down his house? Where did it come from? And will it ever come back again? His search becomes a battle for his planet's survival. Only two things might keep all of Verde from falling to the horrors of Siv's nightmares, but they've been lost for 200 years: technology and magic.</p>";
