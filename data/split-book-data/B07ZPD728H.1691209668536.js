A political coup instigated by the Cordpower Company has upset the monarchial government and the Guild has been caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, Milton has to figure out how to deal with that issue, while at the same time preparing for the inevitable arrival of the threat from the Quizard Mountains.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fortunately, new discoveries of his own has led to great strides in manipulating the Gene Mutations that affect the Proctans. Not only has the introduction of a Neurological Control Unit allowed for the manipulation of abilities, but it also provides something that will change the very nature of how the Proctans view death - and something that Milton, as a gamer, knows very well: respawning.&nbsp;</p> <p>But will those advantages be enough against the threat coming their way?&nbsp;</p> <p>Contains LitRPG/GameLit elements such as level progression and experience, optional tables, no harems, and a heavy Dungeon Core emphasis.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
