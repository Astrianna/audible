window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fifty years ago, <i>Mira</i>, humanity's last hope to find new resources, exited the solar system bound for Proxima Centauri B. Seven years into her mission, all transmissions ceased without warning. <i>Mira</i> and her crew were presumed lost. Humanity, unified during her construction, splintered into insurgency and rebellion. </p> <p>Now, an outpost orbiting Pluto has detected a distress call from an unpowered object entering Sol space: <i>Mira</i> has returned. When all attempts at communications fail, a search and rescue vessel is dispatched from Trident Station to intercept, investigate, and tow the beleaguered <i>Mira</i> to Neptune. </p> <p>As the marines prepare for the journey, uncertainty and conspiracy fomented by Trident Station's governing AIs, begin to take their toll. Upon reaching <i>Mira</i>, they discover they've been sent on a mission that will almost certainly end in catastrophe. </p> <p>The Derelict saga is a suspenseful mashup of hard military sci-fi, space opera, and mystery. </p> <p>Some mysteries shouldn't be solved. </p>";
