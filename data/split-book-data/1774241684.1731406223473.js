window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Not every man can handle a magitech gauntlet that speaks in floating silver text, or a handful of women with unique...needs.</b></p> <p>I’m not every man.</p> <p>When a bad blind date got worse - like, interdimensional lightning storm worse - I woke up to a realm of dragon women, magical kobolds, and a playful monkey girl with a painful secret. I also accidentally (totally on purpose) stole an ancient artifact in the form of a black gauntlet that bonded with my body and unlocked a series of new abilities.</p> <p>So what’s the catch? The glove wasn’t meant for me. It was meant for the fabled Hero of Silura, the only man capable of preventing a gnarly blue ice demon and his army of blood-sucking half-breed children from wiping out the kingdom of dragon descendants that took me in.</p> <p>Now he wants the glove, buckets of blood, and a bridge across the divine veil that separates this realm from Earth. And he’ll be here in three...two..one...</p> <p><b>Warning: This book contains violence, snide comments, explicit sexual encounters, litRPG and gamelit elements, and general badassery.</b></p>";
