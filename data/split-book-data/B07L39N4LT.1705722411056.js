You get this book.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a near future where monsters and humans coexist, Hieronymus \"Jer\" Bennington isn’t your run-of-the-mill psychiatrist. Despite losing his parents to a monster attack, Jer doesn’t judge people by the clothes they wear or the horns on their head. Instead, he runs a controversial clinic where he offers therapy to beastniks, but when his best friend’s suspicious death implicates him for murder, he hunts for the truth in a sexy-dangerous underworld filled with mythical creatures. As part of his journey into a place where fantasies and the stuff of dreams coexist, Jer teams with his harem of powerful monster women as he fights with his mind, a keen eye, and some really gigantic guns to unravel a conspiracy that cuts deeper than any claws or fangs and threatens already tense relations between monsters and humans.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>What you need to know about the book:</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Does it follow the adventures of a heroic but flawed character?
