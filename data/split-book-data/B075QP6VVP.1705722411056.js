window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fourteen outstanding authors. Fourteen extraordinary stories. One best-selling universe. </p> <p>It's the 22nd Century. The galaxy has opened up to humanity as a hyperactive beehive of stargates and new technologies, and we suddenly find ourselves in a vast playground of different races, environments, and cultures. There's just one catch: we are pretty much at the bottom of the food chain. </p> <p>Enter the Four Horsemen universe, where only a willingness to fight and die for money separates Humans from the majority of the other races. Enter a galaxy not only of mercenaries, but also of Peacemakers, bounty hunters, and even a strung out junkie in the way of a hired assassin. </p> <p>Edited by best-selling authors and universe creators Mark Wandrey and Chris Kennedy, <i>A Fistful of Credits</i> includes all-new stories in the Four Horsemen universe by a variety of best-selling authors - and some you may not have heard of...yet. The 14 authors take on various aspects of the universe, giving you additional insight into a galaxy that isn't at war...but definitely isn't at peace. There's only one thing for sure - anything's possible for a fistful of credits! </p> <p>The full list of authors includes Chris Kennedy, Mark Wandrey, Terry Mixon, Jason Cordova, Jon R. Osborne, Kevin Ikenberry, Jon Del Arroz, Kacey Ezell, Christopher Woods, Christopher G. Nuttall, PP Corcoran, Doug Dandridge, Charity Ayres, and Brad R. Torgersen.</p>";
