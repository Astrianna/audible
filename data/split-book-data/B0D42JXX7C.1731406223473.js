Somehow her summoned heroes are all undead?</b></p> <p>How will the church react when their Saintess summons a skeleton in place of a mighty hero? Sofia isn’t too keen on finding out.</p> <p>In this world, Gods choose [Saints], and [Saints] summon [Heroes] from other worlds; everyone knows that. But Sofia had a thing for bones ever since she was a child; there’s only one [Class] she wants: [Necromancer]! When, by the whims of fate, she gets both classes at the same time, the system breaks.</p> <p>Two classes? That isn’t allowed!</p> <p>It cannot be! The system’s administrators would not let it go… If only they were still there.</p> <p>But they were not, and it was too late. Sofia saw an opportunity to abuse a loophole in the system, and she is just the kind of person who would try to stick her whole arm into said loophole if she could if only to see what happens.</p> <p>So, what has the system, running by itself with its mysterious creator missing, done to mend the error? The two classes fused into one.</p> <p>Sofia’s skills from the two classes were broken and mashed together. [Holy Light]? [Raise Skeleton]? What she receives is [Holy Skeleton] instead. But can she escape the Church’s grasp with her newfound powers, or is she destined to forever but some God’s pawn?</p> <p>Follow Sofia as she unknowingly gets tangled in power struggles far beyond what she had bargained for.</p> <p>With millions of views and thousands of followers, this was one of the most popular female-led web serials of 2023. Be ready for a wild ride as you experience the reworked and improved version of Sofia's Skeletal Shenanigans!</p> <p><b>Break a leg, skeleton!</b></p>";
