For decades, only the US Navy has held them back from reclaiming what they believe to be theirs. Now, the American forces are tired after decades of small wars, underfunded, and unprepared for what is coming. And The Bloc has an ace that shifts the balance of power and they intend to play it for all it is worth.</p> <p>As the world plunges into the fires of war, a ragtag force of American, Japanese, and a smattering of other nationalities, sent fleeing across the ocean from Japan with aggressors nipping at their heels, are presented with a choice: Keep running, or choose a battleground and face their fate.</p> <p>No more running. They will make their stand...on Holy Ground.</p>";
