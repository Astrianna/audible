But Otto has a plan: Seize control of the portals, and turn the enemy’s strength against them. </p> <p>To accomplish this seemingly impossible goal, Garenland’s top spies are dispatched to place magical patches on the portals in every capital. Behind enemy lines and on their own, it will be a miracle if the spies can survive, much less complete their missions. </p> <p>Five men will determine Garenland’s future. Can they complete the mission, or with they die trying?</p>";
