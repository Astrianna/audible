It took everything the imperials had to defeat three of the powerful ships in the Pegasus System, but Marshal King, aka Crown Prince Henry, has finally gathered a sufficient force to make the attempt. Events back home have forced his hand, as what Hazard feared most has happened—they’ve lost control of the Black Dragon Virus. Someone stole a sample from the Marxist planet of Lenin, and now it’s ravaging the planet Delhi. After a hurried meeting with the Empress, Hazard rushes back to the front with a new battle plan, for they can’t wait any longer—billions will die if he doesn’t find a sample of the original virus. Ready or not, the Imperial Fleet heads for a showdown in the Sol System. It’s time to find out if Hazard can become the Prince Conqueror.</p>";
