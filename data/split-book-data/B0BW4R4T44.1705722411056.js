window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Surviving the first days of the apocalypse, William is a wreck and hiding in an attic. The daily acid storms, floating elementals, and bizarre mutated animals are the least of his problems. The reality-warping apocalypse has rules and a system much like those in video games. To survive, he must learn how the new uncooperative system works, choose a class without any real knowledge of what it does and create a place safe from the spawning horrors.</p> <p>For William, staying alive isnâ€™t enough. He will need to bring other survivors together and build a fortification large enough for all of them if he ever wants to strike back at the things that took everyone he loved. That is if he can ever gain control over himself and finally get any answers to what has happened.</p>";
