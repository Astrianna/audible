window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Not long ago, the starship </b><b><i>Freedom</i></b><b> was a museum ship. A relic of a bygone era. A rusty old warship converted into a tourist trap.</b></p> <p>Then the aliens attacked. Now, once more, the legendary <i>Freedom</i> flies to war.</p> <p>The war is brutal. The enemy is merciless. The rahs, vicious arachnids from deep space, crave only one thing. Human flesh. Before this terror, Earth’s fleet crumbles. Starships burn. Millions die. But the <i>Freedom</i> still flies. James King, her gruff old commander, still fights.</p> <p>The <i>Freedom</i> will never surrender. The <i>Freedom</i> will never flee. The long, cold night has come to Earth, but the <i>Freedom</i> shines bright. The survivors of the fleet rally behind her. All brave souls heed her call. The <i>Freedom</i> sounds the cry of Earth: <i>We will win!</i></p>";
