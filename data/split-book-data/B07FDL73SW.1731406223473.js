window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sorch is an orc mage in a world where orcs are cursed with stupidity every time they cast a spell. After thwarting an evil plot to destroy Royal Moffit, Sorch became the prisoner of a demon-worshiping cult. They imprisoned him in an attempt to steal his nightmares.</p> <p>One daring jailbreak later, Sorch is unleashed upon the world again. This time, however, he's not so sure he wants to go back to a life of magic and adventure. It would be a long, difficult road, and being the smartest orc in all of Panos wasn't all fun and games the first time around.</p> <p>But with the help of a new friend, Sorch rediscovers his purpose in life. He embarks on a quest to save his friends, who were trapped on another plane of existence. During his travels, he encounters more horrible injury, more magical treasures, casual love, noisy roommates, wild elves, university midterms, a plot against all of Panos, and then of course he saves the world.</p> <p>Or does he?</p>";
