A rusty old warship converted into a tourist trap.</b></p> <p>Then the aliens attacked. Now, once more, the legendary <i>Freedom</i> flies to war.</p> <p>The war is brutal. The enemy is merciless. The rahs, vicious arachnids from deep space, crave only one thing. Human flesh. Before this terror, Earthâ€™s fleet crumbles. Starships burn. Millions die. But the <i>Freedom</i> still flies. James King, her gruff old commander, still fights.</p> <p>The <i>Freedom</i> will never surrender. The <i>Freedom</i> will never flee. The long, cold night has come to Earth, but the <i>Freedom</i> shines bright. The survivors of the fleet rally behind her. All brave souls heed her call. The <i>Freedom</i> sounds the cry of Earth: <i>We will win!</i></p>";
