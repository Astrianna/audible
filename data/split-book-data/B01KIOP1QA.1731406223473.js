window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Raised and trained in seclusion at a secret fortress on the edge of the northern wilds of the Kingdom of Ashai, a young warrior called Rezkin is unexpectedly thrust into the outworld when a terrible battle destroys all that he knows.

New dangers begin to arise that threaten not only Rezkin and his friends, but possibly everyone in Ashai. </p> <p>This is the first installment of an ongoing series.
