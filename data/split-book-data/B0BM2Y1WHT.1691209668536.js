If you wanted armor, weapons, potions, or anything else you might possibly need on an adventure, nobody did it better. Unfortunately, a company in the real world took notice and decided they wanted what Jack had. When he said no, things turned ugly.</p> <p>He might have saved Des—while also killing another demon lord and a monster capable of single handedly wiping out the human capital—but All Trades HQ is a pile of ashes and Zen, Jack's longtime spirit companion, is dead and unable to return from the Spirit Realm. Fortunately, there's a chance to save him. All he has to do is travel between continents, something no player has yet to accomplish, then establish himself in a potentially hostile territory and find a place no living person has ever found. There is one bright side to this whole thing, though: the company that cost him so much has put down roots in the very same place Jack has to travel to. Good thing there's no export tax on revenge, eh?</p> <p>Welcome back to the world of Jack Alltrades, as we explore life's greatest mysteries: How do you read in the library if the lights are off? What's the dirtiest joke you've heard? And can a man learn guitar without playing it at a party?</p>";
