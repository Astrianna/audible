Once he returns to Destiny, he finds out that his little place next to Silver Lake isn’t so little anymore, and he can thank his wives for that. In an amazing change that he seems to be the catalyst for, he never expected that things closer to home would change so much!&nbsp;</p> <p>As he knew, taking the battle to the Gods, he would need allies. He journeys to meet the Demon Kings, the Father of the Dragons, and even the King and Queen of the Angels. He did not expect friendship and a choice he never wanted to make, but they forced it on him. And can he live with it? If not, Earth might suffer.&nbsp;</p> <p>But on the way to these meetings, Jason finds more adventure, with new friends and old. He didn’t expect that the one choice he has to make as a god - a god’s choice - would be his biggest one yet.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Contains harem themes, adult language, and some monster girls.</i></p>";
