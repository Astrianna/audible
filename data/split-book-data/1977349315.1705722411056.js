But why does someone want to keep him from becoming a Duke so badly, that collateral damage doesn't matter?</p> <p>The Midgard war is over, the British coup behind him, but war comes in many forms.</p> <p>Life isn't the same when you fly a desk, unless the desk comes under direct attack.</p> <p>When the dust settles, it takes time to get things done. There is a time to plan and wait, a time for covert deviousness, and a time to strike. In the midst of all else, Jon is confronted with a new journey, to somewhere no one in their right mind would want to go.</p> <p>Actions have consequences, and Sectors have their own problems. What does a Sector Government do when the problem is beyond their immediate resources?</p> <p>They Hire a Hero!</p> <p>Note: This audiobook includes a bonus short story, \"Jane's Christmas.\"<br> &nbsp;</p>";
