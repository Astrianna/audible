Advanced Gaian technology dominates the universe, and it is known as the GAME. Using it without authorization to materialize&nbsp;<i>Night Stalker</i>&nbsp;is prohibited and makes Eli an intergalactic fugitive.&nbsp;</p> <p>As if that were not enough, at the whims and vagaries of Gaian politics, he becomes entangled in an intergalactic conspiracy to steal the leading-edge machinery. Game on! What's a little exploration without all-powerful alien authorities, space battles, and a suicide mission to save the girl?&nbsp;</p> <p>Plunge into the epic Book I of the Midas Touch trilogy — if you're a fan of <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>, you'll love this space opera adventure.&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: This book contains some strong language and graphical depictions of violence.</p>";
