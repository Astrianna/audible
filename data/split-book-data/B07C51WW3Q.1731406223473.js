But as the days wear on with no new arrivals in sight, they begin to fear the worst. Eventually setting out to search for their promised reinforcements, they soon realize that they weren't as alone on the frontier as they thought they were.</p> <p>Just managing to rescue a caravan of settlers in the nick of time from a horde of bandits, Marcus and the rest of Virtus barely have a chance to catch their breath before they find themselves thrust into the middle of Eberian politics, revealing a plot that threatens to not only take away their hard-won independence, but to destroy Aldford completely. </p>";
