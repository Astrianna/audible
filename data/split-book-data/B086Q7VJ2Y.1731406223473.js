window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What would you do if you found a spaceship? Would you call the government, would you pretend you never saw it, or would you keep it a secret? What would you do with it? Use it to gallivant around the galaxy, conquer Earth, get filthy rich, or try to improve life on Earth? Listen along and find out how Marc works to convert Earth into a spacefaring world capable of defending itself and of being united as it meets the other civilizations in the galaxy. He and his brother start planning their next steps, but the one they don’t know how to prepare for is the arrival of Marc’s 12-year-old daughter. She comes to spend the summer with her father. She’s very smart and extremely curious.</p> <p>Marc and his crew need to accomplish all this without tipping off the US government and before the Paraxeans come looking for their spaceship. But they have help, the ship’s AI is on their side, and she’s smart.</p> <p><i>Starship Sakira</i> is the first book in the exciting new adventure series Delphi in Space.</p>";
