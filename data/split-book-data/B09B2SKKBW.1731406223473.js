With his body reverted to the age of 15, the 33-year-old's mind is filled with the possibility of battles and adventures, like the ones in his favorite video games.</p> <p>Unfortunately for him, life isn't always so convenient. Betrayed by the very people who summoned him, he's condemned as the False Hero and forced to flee for his life. Alone in an unfamiliar world and hunted by all of humanity, he takes on the alias of Lutz and uses his gaming knowledge to quickly adapt to the world's strangely game-like mechanics.</p>";
