Or stabbing cows! Douglas loves life, the simple joy of doing repetitive tasks - like battering down a large tower door - is all that's needed to keep his clacking bones satisfied.</p> <p>But just after he completed his most recent task, the wizard he was fighting took out a weird crystalâ€¦and now there are stars everywhere. Will the floating, freezing skeleton find out what happened? Or will that wrecked spaceship on a collision path be the last thing going through his empty skull?</p> <p>Come join Douglas the magical skeleton as he tries to live a fulfilling life in a sci-fi universe!</p>";
