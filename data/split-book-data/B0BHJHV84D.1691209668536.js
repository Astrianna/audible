He’s outgunned, outnumbered, and commands a battleship flown by battered and bloodied reenactors and trainees.</p> <p><b>Yet they must win.</b></p> <p>The Locusts control New Copenhagen, but that’s the only place they can get nuclear warheads for their missiles. They must launch an alpha strike to take the system and hold it against all comers. If they fail, they lose their most potent offensive weapons and leave billions trapped under the invaders’ robotic heels.</p> <p><b>They must not fail.</b></p>";
