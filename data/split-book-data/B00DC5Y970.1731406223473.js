All other plans go on hold when the attempt proves more difficult - and more heartbreakingly costly - than anyone imagined. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the struggle continues on other fronts near and far: in the jungles of Borno in distant Southern Africa and in the Americas, where the allies are finally learning the terrible truth about the twisted Dominion. </p> <p>The Alliance is on the offensive everywhere, but their enemies have a few surprises, including new weaponry and new tactics...and a stunning geographic advantage that Reddy never suspected. Until now.</p>";
