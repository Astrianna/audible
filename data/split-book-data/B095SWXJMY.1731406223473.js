Dropped into a world where sorcerers draw magical power from a deck of cards, summoning monsters and flinging spells, Gareth must adapt to having arcane power at his fingertips. It’s just a shame he’s found himself with the weakest cards around - goblins! </p> <p>Joined by a fallen goddess, a deposed demon king, and surly local, Gareth sets out into Acamida. In a realm where experience points and levels are very real, Gareth must grow stronger if he intends to have his second life last longer than his first. With monsters around every corner and dungeons beneath his feet, Acamida is a dangerous place. </p> <p>As Gareth finds new cards and grows in power, the rumbles of war stir in the west. If he’s going to survive, Gareth will need to master his deck and find the strength hidden within his goblin allies.</p>";
