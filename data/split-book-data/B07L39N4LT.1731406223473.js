window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Even monsters need doctors.</b> </p> <p>What do you get when you take fanciful creatures and monsters, add harem and cyberpunk elements, and toss in the adrenaline-fueled action and mystery of a movie in the vein of <i>Bright</i>? You get this book. </p> <p>In a near future where monsters and humans coexist, Hieronymus \"Jer\" Bennington isn’t your run-of-the-mill psychiatrist. Despite losing his parents to a monster attack, Jer doesn’t judge people by the clothes they wear or the horns on their head. Instead, he runs a controversial clinic where he offers therapy to beastniks, but when his best friend’s suspicious death implicates him for murder, he hunts for the truth in a sexy-dangerous underworld filled with mythical creatures. As part of his journey into a place where fantasies and the stuff of dreams coexist, Jer teams with his harem of powerful monster women as he fights with his mind, a keen eye, and some really gigantic guns to unravel a conspiracy that cuts deeper than any claws or fangs and threatens already tense relations between monsters and humans. </p> <p><b>What you need to know about the book:</b> </p> <p>Does it follow the adventures of a heroic but flawed character? Absolutely.</p> <p>Does it have scenes of thrilling action set in a unique world you’ve never seen before? You know it. </p> <p>Does it contain spicy scenes and monster girls? You bet it does!</p> <p>Warning: This novel contains over-the-top action, undefined relationships/harem, monsters, succubae, mythic creatures, and a hero who is as tactful as a bull in a china shop. Listen at your own risk. Contains adult content. Seriously.</p>";
