The world went through an apocalypse, and what little honor and justice that previously existed is gone. Further, his love has left to the stars somewhere, fighting for those on Earth. </p> <p>Now, Michael has to figure out where he is, where he needs to go, help those who need help, and figure out how to follow in his love's path. Because if there is one thing that honor demands, it is that he make good on his promise to Bethany Anne. </p> <p>Those feeding themselves on the backs of others have very little time to realize an important fact. </p> <p><b>This Dark Messiah has little compunction about killing.</b> </p> <p><i>As noted in other series set in the Kurtherian Universe, there is cursing in this book, occasionally, it's funny, too.</i> </p>";
