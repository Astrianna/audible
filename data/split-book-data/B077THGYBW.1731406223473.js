I didn’t mean for death to come after me. I really didn’t. But it still happened.</p> <p>I’m Zoran, and my name is the only thing I remember about myself; not why I woke up in a forest, not why I taste blood in my mouth, and certainly not why I see weird screens in front of me. Ever since I first woke, all I wanted to do was find out who I really was. But what I didn’t expect was for my search to spark something that was never meant to happen.</p> <p>It has started now. I can see it. Cities will burn and towers will fall. Chaos will descend the heavens and ravage the earth. The darkness is coming, and the world will tremble in its wake.</p> <p>Series Reading Order:</p> <p><i>The Eternal: Awakening</i></p> <p><i>The Eternal: Dragonborn</i></p> <p><i>The Eternal: Transcend</i></p> <p><i>The Eternal: Infinity</i></p>";
