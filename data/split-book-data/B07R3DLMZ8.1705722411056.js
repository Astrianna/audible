So, it's no surprise that Alex Stanton was living every gamer's dream. It was the opposite for him. He was getting paid to play.</p> <p>The latest in virtual reality gaming, in both graphics and hardware, was being beta tested by the largest retailer of online gaming, AltCon. But before they could go live, they wanted serious beta testers. So serious, AltCon was willing to pay and ensure their lives revolved around the Beta, and the Beta only. And the company pulled out all the stops. If there was a heaven for gamers, it would look exactly like this game: Resurgence.</p> <p>However, odd things start happening that Alex can't explain. But like every hard-core gamer, Alex has no problem ignoring them to focus on the big picture; winning the game. Still, in time, even the littlest of things can add up, and Alex finds himself asking, “What’s really going on in Resurgence?”</p> <p>This is a new release of an edition originally published by Joshua W. Nelson.&nbsp;</p>";
