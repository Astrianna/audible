One minute she was living her teenage life in suburban Chicago...and the next minute, she was in a strange place and in a brand new school with absolutely no homework, no rules, and no consequences.</p> <p>Walker Callaghan, 17, is dead.</p> <p>She doesn't go to heaven or hell. She lands at The Academy, a middle realm where teenagers have one thing in common: They were the morning announcement at their high schools because they died young.</p> <p>These high school kids are now caught in a strange “in-between” zone where life hasn’t changed very much. In fact, this special teen limbo looks a lot like life in a quaint Michigan town complete with jocks, popular girls, and cliques. \"There are even cheerleaders in death,\" Walker observes. It's not a coincidence that the music teacher is a guy named Kurt who \"used to have this band\". The drama teacher, Heath, is crush-worthy because back in his life, he starred in some superhero movie.</p> <p>Principal King explains the rules - there are none. Why? You can't die twice.</p> <p>There is no homework.</p> <p>No tests.</p> <p>No SATS.</p> <p>You're just there to learn because the human brain isn't fully formed until you're 24.</p> <p>By the way, you can't get hurt physically, so race your Harley off that hillside. But falling in love is the most dangerous thing you can do...because no one knows how long you'll stay in this realm or what's next.</p>";
