window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Earth is not the cradle of humanity. It is the Throne.</p> <p>Almost 400 years the Terran Imperium has languished, an Empire in name only. The young colonies exploded out of the Diaspora Era, supplanting the homeworld in importance as they left a broken world in their wake. Earth's people, guided by the Conwin line, have clawed and climbed from the darkness left the night the lights went out. They built and rebuilt the weary and weakened world they inherited, even when it seemed bent on killing them from sheer spite.</p> <p>For the new generation, such as Young Eryn Aubrey, a new day seems set to dawn with the Empress' Tri-Centennial surprise announcement of hope and empowerment to the people. There are others, however, who are not nearly so enthused with what The Conwin has to say.</p> <p>The Empire is a sleeping giant, goaded awake amidst tragedy, betrayal, and the machinations of conspiracy.</p> <p>Loyalties will be tested, oaths broken, and bonds reforged. And into the galaxy a confused, angry, woken giant is set loose upon those long used to mocking its existence.</p>";
