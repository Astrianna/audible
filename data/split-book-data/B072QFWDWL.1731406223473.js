window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Black Fleet Saga continues.... </p> <p>A human planet has been invaded. The enigmatic Darshik have landed troops on a frontier world and have begun subduing major cities even as their blockade repels all attempts by the fledgling United Terran Federation to mount a counteroffensive. </p> <p>The Federation's military command is desperate, and with their fleet still in tatters, they make a last-ditch effort to free the planet: They pull Captain Jackson Wolfe out of retirement and put him in command of a ship they hope can get past the defending armada and provide support to the beleaguered Marines and civilians fighting on the surface of the contested world. </p> <p>There is no reasoning with this enemy. If the Terran Federation wants their planet back, they will have to pay the price. </p> <p><i>Iron &amp; Blood</i> is the second book of the Expansion Wars Trilogy and the fifth book of the Black Fleet Saga. </p>";
