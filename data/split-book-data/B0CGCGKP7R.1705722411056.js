window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Eizo Tanya is now living a quiet life as a blacksmith in another world. Well, maybe not so quiet...</b></p> <p>Tales of his cheat-smithing abilities and overpowered blades have started to spread. Alongside his companions, Eizo tries to earn a modest living while avoiding political intrigue. However, intrigue finds him anyway when he saves Diana, the daughter of a comital family. With the nobility embroiled in conflict about the line of succession and the fate of a family heirloom, the safest place for Diana turns out to be with Eizo. As his family keeps growing, the quiet life becomes even more rare.</p> <p>Speaking of rare, Eizo's next commission involves working with a prized fantasy metalâ€”mithril! When an elven village requests that he repair their treasure, a mithril sword, Eizo is excited to take on the challenge. Will this blade be too much for a human blacksmith to handle? Eizo puts his cheats to the test, repairing both swords and societal conflicts, all in pursuit of his dream life!</p> <p>Text copyright 2020 by Tamamaru, Kinta.
