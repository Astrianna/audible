window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are usually two types of luck, but only one seems to visit a certain Dungeon Core....</p> <p>Being in charge of her own dungeon instead of just being an Assistant to a Dungeon Core was a unique experience for Tacca GloomLily, especially after her “bad luck” resulted in her soul being sucked into a Core. Thankfully, she persevered through the strange experience and created a dungeon that she knew Raiders would say was suitable for “beginners”, otherwise known as brand-new Raider Clan recruits. After opening up her dungeon to the world, her entrance was finally located by two local Hill Dwarf farmers, who barely managed to survive their exploratory delve only through Tacca’s intervening actions. With them safely away and able to tell everyone about her dungeon’s presence, she now has to prepare for the flood of Raiders that she hopes will soon appear.</p> <p>Along with Shale IronSchist, her own Dungeon Assistant, Tacca has to develop a way to maximize the few Core Improvement Points she is planning on receiving from the Raider’s presence in her dungeon, as well as what she gains from their deaths. Not only that, but she needs to start thinking towards the future; along with restocking and maintaining her original dungeon, she has to expand into a new section that can adapt to Raiders that grow too powerful to benefit from what she currently has to offer.</p> <p>But not all is as calm outside of her dungeon as it seems. Locally, the two Hill Dwarves that first found her dungeon set up their village to accommodate the influx of new people; however, Raiders from the Clan aren’t the only ones to arrive: Merchants come looking to send their own people to the dungeon, bringing their own problems and dangers with them. Globally, Dungeon Cores that shouldn’t be destroyed are ending up shattered, and no one can seem to figure out why.</p> <p>And just her luck, Tacca seems to be in the middle of it all....</p> <p>This story contains Dungeon Core elements such as dungeon construction and defense, LitRPG/GameLit mechanics such as character progression and stats, and contains no harems/sexual content or profanity.</p>";
