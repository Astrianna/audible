window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In addition to strength, steel, and courage, a hero discovers he's in need of a friend, in the first installment of a daring and dangerous fantasy adventure.</b></p> <p>When it comes to action and adventure, every hero needs a good sidekick. Holmes has Watson, Batman has Robin, and Daniel has&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Orrin. More like brothers than friends, they always have each other's backs. And as Daniel is the big, strong, handsome type, Orrin is more than happy to remain in his shadow at school, at parties, pretty much everywhere.</p> <p>Then things take a turn for the truly weird when a terrible accident catapults the pair into a world totally unlike their own, in which the rules of a role-playing game hold sway. Naturally, Daniel is classified as a \"hero,\" while Orrin is—also naturally—relegated to the fantasy equivalent of \"bleh.\" Nothing new there.</p> <p>But in this realm populated with lethal foes both inhuman and inescapable, sticking together matters more than ever, and soon Daniel and Orrin will discover more about themselves—and each other—than either one thought possible. In fact, Orrin just might find the confidence and strength to become something other than your average sidekick&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than 600,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
