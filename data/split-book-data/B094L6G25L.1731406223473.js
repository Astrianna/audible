If he's willing to give up his entire life, he can travel for 800 years in stasis to planet Epigog 31 to receive treatment. With no other options available, he agrees.</p> <p>Once there, he discovers that aliens exist and they are allies with humanity. But there's a catch to receiving treatment: While his body heals, he must act as muscle for the aliens.</p> <p>His conscious mind is uploaded into a mechanical battle unit and he is sent to train for warfare.</p> <p>He will travel the galaxy, meet numerous aliens, and make friends along the way. But everything is not as it seems, and Jack's mech is far more unique than he realizes.</p>";
