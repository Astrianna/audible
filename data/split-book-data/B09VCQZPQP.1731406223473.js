window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Alvin and his wives had been busy over the last few weeks. They’d gone out of their way to visit settlements they’d helped in the past, all while killing a string of mini-bosses across what had been the American west. Life looked good for Team Asshole…until the devs made a mistake.</b></p> <p>Without any warning, Sammi stopped showing up. At first, they brushed it off as her being too busy, or maybe in trouble. That changed when a new dev showed up and tried to assert his dominance. That man was killed twice - first by Alvin blowing his head off his shoulders, then by Mousie running him through with both of her swords.</p> <p>With the gloves off, Team Asshole started breaking things they’d left alone. They circumvented rules left and right, cheated fast travel, and did everything else they could. A third dev appeared and pleaded for a chance to explain.</p> <p>Sammi hadn’t been fired, they were told. Instead, there was an unexpected development - Sammi was the first alpha tester. Now that they knew their friend was fine - and might even join them soon - Alvin and his wives backed off their shenanigans to give the new dev, Renato, a chance.</p> <p>It wasn’t long after that that they received a message from Sammi. She was in New Orleans, stuck in the Superdome with a Loa named Erzulie, and she needed their help. With no hesitation, they loaded up their helicopter, Sky Blade, and set off to rescue Sammi and those with her.</p> <p>After barely pulling off the rescue of Sammi and half a dozen other women, Team Asshole returned to their base. In the aftermath, Sammi joined Team Asshole fully, accepted as another wife by Alvin and with Gothy’s enthusiastic approval.</p>";
