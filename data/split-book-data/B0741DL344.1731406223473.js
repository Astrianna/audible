The Argonauts were born. </p> <p>But it wasn't easy. </p> <p>Ruthless bankers are breathing down their necks, vengeful warlords are promising to pursue them across the galaxy, and now a mysterious new client wants Rade and his Argonauts to escort her to a frontier planet. </p> <p>Problem is, the new client won't reveal her cargo.
