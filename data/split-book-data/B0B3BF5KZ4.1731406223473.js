More floors, more monsters, newer loot—all in the service of acquiring power to finish off the Voidbringers once and for all...and being the greatest core of all time.</b></p> <p>But Will has a problem. He can’t figure out how reach his enemies in order to finish them, and they are preparing their next devastating blow.</p> <p>Will’s dwarven allies, the Kingdom of Daruk, need to recover from the shattering of their capital and the death of their king.
