At least if the big governments on Earth don’t stop them. They’ve managed to accumulate enough money to build a city, and now they’re going to build a space station that will create a safe place to manufacture their new technology, and a way to demonstrate to the world that humans have a future in space. </p> <p>But as they demonstrate more advanced technology, they attract more interest from the world’s governments. The people in power aren’t too happy to be sharing it with some small company in the South Pacific. What will it take to keep their dream alive? <br> </p>";
