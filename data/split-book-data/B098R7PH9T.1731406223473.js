window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Second edition: revised for content and additional editing</i> </p> <p><b>Can one person change all of Uniworld by herself?</b> </p> <p>Cadence, the extraordinarily powerful Song Mistress, is back for the final installment of the Uniworld Online Trilogy! Joined by her friends in-game, she embarks on a journey to, somehow, bring peace to Uniworld - all while avoiding attempts from her own faction to kill her. </p> <p>Now knowing who brutally attacked her back in reality - if not yet his real-life identity - Cadence must get stronger, learn more about her abilities, and devise a strategy which would make him confess to his involvement in her attack. To do that, however, she needs to survive long enough; the doing of which will be difficult, especially with the entirety of the Light faction out to get her. </p> <p>With the only avenue for escape among their “enemies”, Cadence and her friends travel to the Dark faction, where she learns much-needed information regarding one of her oldest and most important quests. From that information stems an expedition into the unknown, which will bring her closer to her goal...and her destiny. </p> <p>Find out how it all ends in the thrilling conclusion to the Uniworld Online Trilogy!</p> <p><i>Contains LitRPG elements such as character progression, quests, skills, stats, and stat sheets. No harems or foul language.</i></p> <p><b>Update: </b>A few repeat errors have been fixed as of 7/12/21.</p>";
