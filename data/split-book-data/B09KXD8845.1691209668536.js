window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An unsuspecting carnival is about to get a dose of serial killer magic.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>After two successful completed objectives, our not-so-friendly Spirit Core finds himself in an unexpected location. Instead of “haunting” a house and killing the residents inside using their own fear against them, the intangible entity ends up arriving at his new objective floating above a traveling carnival, of all places.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, the reincarnated soul of emotionless serial killer, Clive Logan, must successfully kill at least some of the carnival’s visitors - but how? Luckily, the Goddess of the Underworld has provided the Spirit Core with a variety of new mechanics suited to his new location; these mechanics will allow Clive to raise their FEAR Levels up to the point where they can be killed from fear alone. Coupled with his minions, Preston and Brittany Miller - who are due to arrive any day - it should be a simple enough execution of his objective.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are forces waging their efforts against him. Father Stryker is closing in on his location; if Clive makes a wrong move, he could end up being exorcized and destroyed, ending his reign of death before he could really get his momentum going. Added to that, the carnival’s employees have a secret that they are hiding, which could potentially bring more attention to his location than he’d prefer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will Clive be able to kill to his satisfaction, or will he be stopped before his objective is complete? Find out now in <i>Carnival of Fear</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Warning: There are some very sensitive and disturbing criminal activities contained in this book, as well as it being the tale of a serial killer doing what serial killers do; so, if you are opposed to those sorts of things, turn back now....</p> <p><i>Contains LitRPG/GameLit aspects such as statistics and leveling, as well as Dungeon Core elements.</i>&nbsp;</p>";
