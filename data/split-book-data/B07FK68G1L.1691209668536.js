A half-wit ogre, a legion of overgrown jungle beasts, and a power-tripping AI are trying to stop her.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Relic Online</i> is the hottest new game out there, and it's Devon Walker's best hope for escaping her hard-knock life. Thanks to her rocking achievements in other games, she's been hired as a salaried player. Even better, her new position comes with cutting-edge implants that turn RO's virtual reality into a full-sensory explosion. Her only task? Drive the game's creator AI to the outermost limits of its creativity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sounds easy, right?&nbsp;</p> <p>But when Devon logs in, her expectations shatter like an ice golem hit with a sonic blast. Wearing nothing but a cloth tunic and ragged pants, she spawns inside a ruined city overgrown by steamy jungle.
