The aliens know where all Human-occupied worlds are while their own worlds are still unknown.

Not content with gradually pushing Humanity back, Shiloh's vision reveals a massive attack on Earth that will have terrible consequences. So far his visions have all come true. Can his A.I. allies make the difference between extermination and survival for the Human Race?</p>";
