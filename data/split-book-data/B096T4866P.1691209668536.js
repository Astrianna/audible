After spending 10 years on Titan where he went through rehab and attended college, he was now returning home to Conclave Station. A freak meteor storm had virtually destroyed the rock-tug his family called home, killing his parents and taking his arm and leg. Reuniting with his lifelong friends - Mal, a computer genius, and Jazz, a natural-born pilot, he started a mining and shipping business. However, while repairing their rock-tug, they stumbled upon a way to control artificial gravity, creating a gravitational force field.</p> <p>The massive and powerful Corporation found out about the new tech and realized it will change the balance of power, something its managers can’t allow to happen. Everyone wants this new tech and are willing to do anything to get it. When his friends are almost killed, Nic begins to take it personally and starts using their tactics against them. It soon becomes a no-holds-barred shooting war that spans the Solar System.</p>";
