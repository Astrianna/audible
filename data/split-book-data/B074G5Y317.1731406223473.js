window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first novel in Lawrence Watt-Evans' <i>Obsidian Chronicles: Dragon Weather</i>. </p> <p>Arlian had lived his entire life on the Smoking Mountain - the stony ground, jagged peaks, and black glass were all he had ever known. </p> <p>But then came dragon weather: Oppressive heat, dark and angry clouds...weather that lured the dragons from their caverns deep beneath the earth. </p> <p>And the dragons came - monsters with no sympathy for humans; dragons who destroyed his entire village and everyone in it. Everyone, that is, except Arlian. </p> <p>Orphaned and alone, Arlian is taken by looters and sold into slavery, sent to labor in the mines for the rest of his life - until a freak accident and an act of mercy sets him free. </p> <p>Free to seek revenge on the looters, the slavers - and the dragons. </p> <p>But in all of history, no one has ever slain a dragon. Can one obsessed young man change the world and do what no one has ever done before? </p>";
