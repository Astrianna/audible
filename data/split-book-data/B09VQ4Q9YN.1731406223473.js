From delicious fried Dicken to a fiery whiskey brewed from demonic corn, the friends eat and drink their way through the chaos that is <i>DCO</i>. Gaming is supposed to be fun after all, and leveling is always a little better when you’re tipsy right?</p> <p>It’s going to be a wild ride, with levels, achievements, bosses, and more–but mostly there's going to be a lot of Dicken around.</p> <p><i>Ever wanted to see Dungeon Core Online from the players' point of view?
