window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Jason—with the gang—is back, and he has a plan: get rid of all the Primes...since they are causing issues.</b></p> <p>It seems that Jason is about to bring down something that has stood for eons in secret, controlling the universe. The Primes have worked in the background for ages, ruling the universe as they saw fit, but not always to the benefits of the races. But Jason is taking them out, since to him, they are nothing more than petty gods who are choosing to use the people of the universe as pawns.</p> <p>With the help of his family, friends, a cute but ferocious dragon and the Proxasi’s Protectors, he hopes to change it so that the rest of the universe can live without the interference of the Primes.</p> <p><i>This book contains harem themes, language, adult situations, and some monster girls.</i></p>";
