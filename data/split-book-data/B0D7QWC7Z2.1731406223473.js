And a portal to a fantasy world.</p> <p>Those kind of outweigh the negatives.</p> <p>At first, I thought I was just testing the latest VR survival RPG, but I'm starting to think this might not be a game after all. The monsters are definitely life-like and capable of carving me apart on their worst days. But on their best days, I make them mine.</p> <p>Yeah, I have the Tamer Class.</p> <p>There's strength in numbers in survival scenarios like this, a fact that becomes only too clear when I'm joined by a redhead who's apparently a Warlock.</p> <p>I figure it won't be long until our party's number increases in this strange new world.</p>";
