Welcome to MythRune.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>With his glory days behind him and nothing but life as a loser to look forward to, Zane can’t wait for MythRune. A first-of-its-kind immersive fantasy game that promises to provide just the escape from reality a washed-up athlete like him needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But when his younger brother learns he only has weeks left to live, Zane is forced to take his gaming to the next level if he’s going to afford to pay for his brother’s operation and ditch their sorry life forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>To celebrate the launch of MythRune, the game’s developers announce a worldwide player tournament.
