window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Amongst the remnants of the ancient Saidican Empire lies Golias Hollow, an underground community of people who’ve taken refuge from the tainted surface. Completely cutoff from the outside world, the men and women of the Hollow follow the teachings of the prophet Dormiar, sacrificing a select few to the outside each year in a ceremony known as “The Choosing”. </p> <p>Aristial Stoneblood, orphan and occasional troublemaker, is one of this year’s Chosen. Along with his beautiful childhood friend, Kerys Weaver, Aristial leaves the safety of the Hollow and enters an unfamiliar world of shapeshifting swords, respawning monsters, and dangerous dungeons. It’s a new beginning, a place where intimate bonds can hold power, and the price of life is paid in magical essence. </p> <p>A post-apocalyptic, dungeon-crawling, fantasy harem adventure. </p> <p><b>Warning:</b> This audiobook contains a significant amount of explicit sexual content and some adult emotional situations. Listener discretion is advised.</p>";
