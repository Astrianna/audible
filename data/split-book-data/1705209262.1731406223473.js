window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>No matter how many times you die, it still sucks.</p> <p>For Hudson, the virtual world of PrimeVerse isn't all bad. It's beautiful; much nicer than overpopulated Earth. It almost feels like a vacation except for the volatile wildlife, lack of any amenities, and - oh yeah - the inability to log out.</p> <p>Exploring the world, learning his class, and leveling skills is all fun and games until a powerful rogue player with a vendetta shows up to wipe out Hudson and his primitive tribe. Thrust into a conflict he didn't create, Hudson is forced into a cycle of respawning where he learns that even death can be used as a tool. So much for that vacation.</p> <p>It's not like he signed up for this. Or even went willingly. but when life hands you lemons...use them to kill the dog-size spiders that are trying to eat your face.</p>";
