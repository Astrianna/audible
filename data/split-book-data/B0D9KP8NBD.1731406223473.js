window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alone and unafraid, the former Earth colony of Serenity is safe from the Mordorian Horde…for the moment. Hazard King’s expeditionary force, battered and bruised, stands guard, protecting the system. But to complete his original mission—to get to Earth and obtain the Black Dragon information he needs to save the kingdom—Hazard will need reinforcements. His mother, Empress Elizabeth, is willing to organize that help, but it will take time.</p> <p>For the moment, Hazard is on his own.</p> <p>When Imperial scouts discover a major enemy base in the MT Pegasi System, Hazard’s plans change. The former colony, 90 light years from Earth, is home to a large Mordorian Fleet, a fleet that Hazard must defeat. They not only block the way forward, but have enslaved two million humans.</p> <p>With the majority of reinforcements yet to arrive, and against the advice of his commanders, Hazard attacks the system to open the way to Earth and free the subjugated colony. He is the man the colony needs.</p> <p>He is…Prince Liberator.</p>";
