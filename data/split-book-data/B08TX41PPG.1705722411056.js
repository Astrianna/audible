It's time to move on to something more...obscure.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Battlegrounds Online</i> is the only game of its kind. A VRMMOFPS. A military warfare game so realistic that it scares away most players daring enough to try it. Realistic in the combat but not in the setting, the game is based around a toy property from the 1980sâ€”a property that Eric's grandfather was a fan of, passing that love down to Eric.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, as a soldier codenamed Zag, Eric gets to play in that near-future world full of colorful and insane terrorists. He gets to be one of the characters he heard his grandfather rave about.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Eric will find that not all games are created equal. Some are more real. So real, they can affect you both in and out of the game.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Experience this high-adrenaline LitRPG/Lit-FPS adventure from the author behind Sky Realms Online. An action-packed thrill ride that puts you right in the crosshairs. </b></p>";
