window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now available in one discounted collection, the Jurassic Dead omnibus edition includes all three novels in the action-horror trilogy that <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Jonathan Maberry calls, \"A wild collision of modern SF and old-school horror...over the top, inventive and scary fun!\" </p> <p><i>Jurassic Dead</i> </p> <p>An Antarctic research team hoping to study microbial organisms in an underground lake discovers something far more amazing: perfectly preserved dinosaur corpses. After one thaws and wakes ravenously hungry, it becomes apparent that, like life, death will find a way. </p> <p>Environmental activist Alex Ramirez, son of the expedition's paleontologist, came to Antarctica to defend the organisms from extinction, but soon learns that it is the human race that needs protecting. </p> <p><i>Jurassic Dead, Book 2: Z-volution</i> </p> <p>After the discovery of a dormant zombie virus in preserved Antarctic dinosaur specimens, billionaire visionary and megalomaniac William DeKirk proceeds with his plan to unleash a zombie-dinosaur army upon the world, starting with Washington D&gt;C. The US military struggles to prevent the contagion's spread and to defend against the onslaught of prehistoric monstrosities as all-out war breaks out between the living and the dead. </p> <p>However, DeKirk has even farther-reaching plans. Modifying the virus to allow for greater control, he intends to impart upon himself all the benefits of zombie-ism - near indestructibility, immortality, and immunity to attacks of other zombies, including the dinosaurs, which he can now direct at will. Nothing can stop him from eradicating civilization as we know it, except possibly returning heroes Alex Ramirez and Veronica Winters. </p> <p>The unlikely pair must rescue the one scientist who may hold the key to arresting the zombie apocalypse, a CDC expert trapped in a besieged Atlanta office. Can they secure the antidote and turn the tide before the plague reaches its full potential, or will the planet return to the dominion of its long-extinct masters and a new tide of undead humanity? </p> <p><i>Jurassic Dead, Book 3: Ctrl-Z</i> </p> <p>Three months after the fall of Washington D.C., the planet is a hellish battleground for an all-out war between prehistoric undead forces and the scattered remnants of the living. Billionaire William DeKirk, now ruling the last vestiges of civilization, is human no longer, but rather an unpredictable rogue driven by a noxious blend of primordial virus and modern day sociopath. He deliberately spreads the zombie plague across the world and deploys his dinosaur-human army to destroy survivors or coerce them into pledging allegiance to his undead flag. </p> <p>But the resistance movement has its own plan to hit Ctrl-Z and undo the zombie apocalypse. In his darkest moment yet, Alex must confront the grim reality that the only way to defeat a monster is to become one himself. </p>";
