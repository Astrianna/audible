According to the message, humanity had been reset over a million times and every single time we could not prevent our own extinction.&nbsp;</p> <p>No more resets for humanity. No more chances.&nbsp;</p> <p>They would leave our world an irradiated disaster, but to keep things interesting, they would convert our species simulation to a game for their twisted entertainment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Digital or not, real or not, I have a family to protect. A wife and daughter who need me, universe be damned. I say bring it on. Welcome to the end of the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Welcome to <i>The Great Filter.</i></p>";
