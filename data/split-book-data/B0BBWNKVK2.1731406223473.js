But when they meet the new enemy in battle, it becomes obvious that the Overlords aren’t telling us everything, and Lance and Sofia are forced to wonder if they’re fighting for the right side. With the Overlords holding the Solar System, though, does it matter?</p> <p><b><i>It’s time to plug back in and save the world.</i></b></p>";
