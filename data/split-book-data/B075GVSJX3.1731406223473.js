One of the few heroes he respects has been captured, and now, Cal must rely on his wit, technical skills, and a healthy dose of The Big Lie, to pull off a daring rescue from inside a villain's base. </p> <p>Along the way, he and his team of New Renegades will have to worry about an imposter, human/animal Manglermal hybrids, a naked woman, an evil scientist, a terrifying plan, and the ever intrusive presence of Big Brother. Can Cal keep the fact that he's really alive a secret? What hidden truths has Aphrodite been holding onto and how will it change their relationship? </p> <p>All these questions await Cal, but, most importantly, why are you still reading the description? You should already be listening to chapter one! </p>";
